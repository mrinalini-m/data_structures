Data Structures

Data Structures that I've coded. Extracted from https://github.com/mrinalini-m/algorithms.

1. [x] Dynamic Array
2. [x] Hash Table
3. [x] Linked List
4. [x] Stack
5. [x] Queue
6. [x] Binary Search Tree
7. [x] Binary Tree Traversal (DFS, BFS)
8. [x] Graph
9. [x] Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)
10. [x] Trie
11. [x] Binary Heap (Min, Max)

## Usage

1. To do a quick check for a test case in a particular file, run `npx babel-node src/FileName.js` from root.
2. Files with private class properties don't require babel to transpile them and `node src/FileName.js` will run them without errors but some files with private class methods do require babel.

## Testing

Tests are written using and run by [Jest test framework](https://jestjs.io/).

Run `npm run test` from root or sub folders to run tests.
